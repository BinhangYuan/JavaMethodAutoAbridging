Parse the name and attributes from a start tag.<p> From the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/intro/sgmltut.html#h-3.2.2\"> HTML 4.01 Specification, W3C Recommendation 24 December 1999<\/a> http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/intro/sgmltut.html#h-3.2.2<p> <cite> 3.2.2 Attributes<p> Elements may have associated properties, called attributes, which may have values (by default, or set by authors or scripts). Attribute/value pairs appear before the final \">\" of an element's start tag. Any number of (legal) attribute value pairs, separated by spaces, may appear in an element's start tag. They may appear in any order.<p> In this example, the id attribute is set for an H1 element: <code> &lt;H1 id=\"section1\"&gt; <\/code> This is an identified heading thanks to the id attribute <code> &lt;/H1&gt; <\/code> By default, SGML requires that all attribute values be delimited using either double quotation marks (ASCII decimal 34) or single quotation marks (ASCII decimal 39). Single quote marks can be included within the attribute value when the value is delimited by double quote marks, and vice versa. Authors may also use numeric character references to represent double quotes (&amp;#34;) and single quotes (&amp;#39;). For doublequotes authors can also use the character entity reference &amp;quot;.<p> In certain cases, authors may specify the value of an attribute without any quotation marks. The attribute value may only contain letters (a-z and A-Z), digits (0-9), hyphens (ASCII decimal 45), periods (ASCII decimal 46), underscores (ASCII decimal 95), and colons (ASCII decimal 58). We recommend using quotation marks even when it is possible to eliminate them.<p> Attribute names are always case-insensitive.<p> Attribute values are generally case-insensitive. The definition of each attribute in the reference manual indicates whether its value is case-insensitive.<p> All the attributes defined by this specification are listed in the attribute index.<p> <\/cite> <p> This method uses a state machine with the following states: <ol> <li>state 0 - outside of any attribute<\/li> <li>state 1 - within attributre name<\/li> <li>state 2 - equals hit<\/li> <li>state 3 - within naked attribute value.<\/li> <li>state 4 - within single quoted attribute value<\/li> <li>state 5 - within double quoted attribute value<\/li> <li>state 6 - whitespaces after attribute name could lead to state 2 (=)or state 0<\/li> <\/ol> <p> The starting point for the various components is stored in an array of integers that match the initiation point for the states one-for-one, i.e. bookmarks[0] is where state 0 began, bookmarks[1] is where state 1 began, etc. Attributes are stored in a <code>Vector<\/code> having one slot for each whitespace or attribute/value pair. The first slot is for attribute name (kind of like a standalone attribute).\n * @param start The position at which to start scanning.\n * @return The parsed tag.\n * @exception ParserException If a problem occurs reading from the source.\n */\n"}]}
